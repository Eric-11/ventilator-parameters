CSV data for models. They are sampled from data found on the internet.

They are in seconds and cm H2O. If anyone has more csv or images of respiration that could share it would be very helpful to the robustness of our project.  They can also be in the form of an image and I can digitize the data and extract a csv version for my model.

Thanks anything helps.
